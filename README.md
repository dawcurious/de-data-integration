# Enterprise Data Integration Take-Home

Build a Python + SQL pipeline that combines sales data from a core SQL Server
source and an acquired PostgreSQL source into a Snowflake sales fact table.


## Inputs

Use the CSV fixtures in `data/`:

- `sqlserver_mock.csv`: core SQL Server sales.
- `postgres_mock.csv`: acquired PostgreSQL sales.
- `exchange_rates.csv`: currency conversion rates.
- `expected_sales_fact.csv`: expected final fact output.
- `expected_rejects.csv`: expected rejected records.

## Requirements

- Implement an OOP Python pipeline with `main.py` as the entry point.
- Use an abstract extractor contract, concrete SQL Server/PostgreSQL extractors, a Snowflake staging loader, and a reusable SQL script runner.
- Run locally from the provided CSVs; live SQL Server/PostgreSQL instances are not required.
- Load staged source data and final transformed outputs into Snowflake.
- Put Snowflake-native transformations in `src/sql/`.

## Transformations To Handle

- Source-prefixed warehouse keys, e.g. `core:9001` and `acquired:9001`.
- Currency normalization to USD.
- SQL Server `customer_blob` JSON parsing.
- Mixed date format normalization.
- SKU cleanup from prefixes such as `PROD-` and `SKU-`.
- Duplicate source transaction detection.
- Reject handling for invalid JSON, missing SKU, unknown currency, and
  duplicates.

## Expected Output

After processing SQL Server and PostgreSQL data, the final fact table can
be written to Snowflake and match `data/expected_sales_fact.csv`.

Rejected rows should be written to Snowflake and match
`data/expected_rejects.csv`.

Suggested Snowflake objects (Feel free to change as you see fit):

```text
DE_INTEGRATION.RAW.STG_CORE_SALES
DE_INTEGRATION.RAW.STG_ACQUIRED_SALES
DE_INTEGRATION.RAW.STG_EXCHANGE_RATES
DE_INTEGRATION.ANALYTICS.SALES_FACT
DE_INTEGRATION.ANALYTICS.SALES_REJECTS
```

Required fact columns:

```text
source_system
source_transaction_id
warehouse_transaction_id
checkout_timestamp
customer_id
customer_country
sku
gross_amount_usd
tax_amount_usd
is_refunded
```

## Project Layout : Feel free to change

```text
config/dummy.yml
data/*.csv
main.py
src/extractors/base_extractor.py
src/extractors/postgres.py
src/extractors/sqlserver.py
src/loaders/snowflake.py
src/sql/staging_core.sql
src/sql/staging_acquired.sql
src/sql/warehouse_merge.sql
src/transformers/sql_runner.py
tests/
```

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run:

```bash
python main.py
```


## Deliverables and Presentation

- Runnable pipeline.
- Implemented Python modules and SQL scripts.
- Be ready for questions in a follow-up technical discussion like
  * How the design satisfies idempotency, incremental loading, and data quality checks. 
  * How you handle db credentials
  * How would your approach change for 100 million rows instead of these CSVs
  * Python OOP : Why use an abstract BaseExtractor instead of just functions?
  * Snowflake loading: Would you use row inserts, PUT/stage/COPY INTO, Snowpipe, or external stages? Why?

## AI Policy

Generative AI tools are allowed. Candidates are responsible for everything they
submit and should be able to explain the Python design, SQL transformations,
data quality handling, tests, and tradeoffs in a follow-up technical discussion.
